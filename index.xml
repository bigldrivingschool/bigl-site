      <description>About Big L Driving School My name is Pravin Kalyan also known as PK and I am NZTA qualified and hold dual qualification of Driving Instructor and Driver Testing Officer. In my previous role of Driver Testing Officer, I have carried out thousands of restricted and full driving test and have seen varying driving standards. Each time I witnessed poor performance by the drivers, I wished I could help to improve their driving standards but my role as Driver Testing Officer prevented me from helping apart from debriefing after the driving test with recommendation for improving their driving standards.</description>

<h2 id="learner-licence">Learner licence</h2>

<p>We can assist you with passing your theory test by directing you to the available resources and/or sitting with you on
one on one basis to explain and reason out various scenarios. Outlined below are references to available resources for
the learner licence requirements. (source: NZTA website)</p>

<p>The NZ Transport Agency sets the following conditions for Learners Licence You need to be 16 or older when you sit the learner licence test.
You do the test on a computer at an AA/ VTNZ Centre. The test has 35 multi-choice questions If you answer at least 32 correctly, you pass.
When you pass you get a learner licence, and you can start learning to drive with a supervisor or a driving instructor.</p>

<p>Learn the road rules To keep everyone safe on the road, you need to learn the road rules before you can get your learner licence.
You’ll need to pass a test to prove that you understand the rules for driving safely in New Zealand. You can prepare for this by reading
the New Zealand road code, or by working your way through <a href="https://drive.govt.nz/get-your-learners/interactive-road-code">interactive road code</a>.
You can sit official practice learner tests at <a href="http://www.roadcodepractice.co.nz/">Rode Code Practice</a> and at the <a href="https://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/roadcode/">NZTA road codes site</a>.</p>

<p>test</p>

<h2 id="restricted-licence">Restricted licence</h2>

<p>We teach you to drive in a very safe and supportive environment under the guidance and expertise of a professional driving
instructor who has been an Ex-Driver Testing Officer with VTNZ and conducted thousands of driving test whilst in that role.
Pravin (PK) is a very patient and caring and promotes safe driving skills.</p>

<p>As an Ex Driver Testing Officer, Pravin (PK) is ideally placed to instruct you on your driving skills, as well as preparing
you for your driving test. He knows exactly how the practical licence test works, and the assessment and marking criteria used.
In addition, Pravin (PK) can also act as your support person during your actual test if this is required.</p>

<p>Learn the road rules NZTA recommends 120 hours of driving practice prior to sitting for your Restricted Licence. This can be
a combination of driving school lessons and driving with other supervisors in between your formal lessons. The more you drive
the better you get with your driving ability. Being taught by a professional instructor will greatly enhance your chances
of passing your Restricted Licence test.</p>

<h4 id="the-restricted-licence-test">The restricted licence test</h4>

<p>The Restricted Test is intended to check that you have sufficient knowledge of the road rules and the necessary driving
skills required to be a safe and competent driver. It will expose you to a variety of driving situations that you would
be likely to encounter during your normal driving.</p>

<p>In order to pass the test, you will need to demonstrate that you are safe to be driving by yourself and without supervision.</p>

<p>The Restricted Licence driving test lasts for approximately 1 hour in total. It consists of 2 stages – the first stage
is in a lower speed area and is intended to test your basic driving skills and that you are a safe driver. If you pass
the first stage, you will progress to the next stage, which involves higher speeds and busier traffic and road conditions.
You will be assessed on a variety of manoeuvres involving intersections, lane changes, turning and interaction with other road users.</p>

<p>To pass Stage 1 of the test, you cannot incur any more than 1 ‘critical error’ and no ‘immediate fail errors’.
You also cannot incur too many ‘negative’ points which will result in a ‘points fail’. To pass the test overall, you
cannot incur more than 2 ‘critical errors’ overall, no ‘immediate fail errors’ and not incurring too many ‘negative’ points.</p>

<p><strong>To keep you safe while you’re still on restricted licence, there are some conditions you must follow:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>you can drive on your own between 5am and 10pm.</p></li>

<li><p>you can only drive between 10pm and 5am if you have a supervisor in the front passenger seat.</p></li>

<li><p>If you’re driving without a supervisor, you can only take a passenger if they are:</p></li>

<li><p>your spouse or partner (for example the person you live with as if you’re married or in a civil union)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>A useful resource for learner drivers sitting for their Restricted Licences is a website put together by
NZTA – <a href="https://drive.govt.nz">https://drive.govt.nz</a>. This is aimed specifically at learner drivers and explains the Restricted Licence test process in detail.</p>

<h2 id="full-licence">Full licence</h2>

<p>Following successfully attaining the restricted licence, the next step is Full Licence. Whilst you are driving under restricted
licence , you are actually practising driving for your full licence and that you are still learning.</p>

<h4 id="the-full-licence-test">The full licence test</h4>

<p>To be eligible to sit for your Full Licence, you must have held your Restricted Licence for the required period of time.
Obtaining your Full Licence will remove the restrictions such as carrying passengers, driving at night or driving a manual vehicle.</p>

<p>You must have held your Restricted Licence for at least 18 months and be 18 years of age or older, or if you have sat an
approved advanced driving course/ defensive driving course, had you Restricted Licence for 12 months and be at least 17
and half years old. If you are 25 years old or over, you must have held your Restricted Licence for at least 6 months,
which is reduced to 3 months with an approved advanced driving course/ defensive driving course.</p>

<p>The purpose of the Full Licence Test is to ensure that you are able to drive legally and according to the NZ road rules
and are able to demonstrate suitable driving skills. The duration of the Full Licence driving test is approximately 30
minutes. The test involves assessing your general driving skills with a key component of the driving test being hazard
detection and response commentary, as directed by the testing officer, where you will need to verbally identify hazards
and provide appropriate response for the hazards identified.</p>

<p>In order to pass the test, you can not incur more than 1 ‘critical error’ and no ‘immediate fail errors’ and not incur
too many ‘negative’ points which will result in a ‘points fail’. The negative points mostly arise from insufficient hazard
detection and response commentary. Other areas of assessment where negative points are incurred are from lack of observation
skills, signalling errors, poor gap selections and incorrect following distances.</p>

<h2 id="overseas-conversion">Overseas conversion</h2>

<p>Moving to a new country is exciting and challenging. Depending on the country you have come from, you may be required to sit
for a theory test followed by a full practical driving test before being granted a full New Zealand driver licence.</p>

<p>If you’re here for a year or more, you need a New Zealand driver licence. If your overseas licence is still current, or expired
less than 12 months ago, you can apply to convert it to a New Zealand licence. Whether you’re in New Zealand for a short time or
you’re here to stay, you need to bring your current driver licence from your home country. You may also need an international driving permit or a translation of your licence if it’s not in English.</p>

<p>We are able to assist you to become familiar with New Zealand driving conditions and requirements so that you can drive safely
and help prepare you for your Overseas Conversion driving test.</p>

<p>We highly recommend at least 6 to 8 weeks of driving practice with your supervisor before booking for your full driving test</p>

<p>The practical driving test for Overseas Conversions is based on the Full Licence Test.</p>

<h2 id="mock-test">Mock test</h2>

<p>A mock driving test allows you and your driving instructor to identify any areas of your driving that need improvement
before taking your actual practical driving test. During the mock test you also get to familiarise with what to expect on the actual test.</p>

<p>If you have already sat your driving test and unfortunately failed and have lost confidence, then Mock Driving test prior
to rebooking is strongly recommended.</p>

<p>As an Ex Driver Testing Officer, Pravin (PK) is conversant with the driving test routes and the driver testing officers
assessment and marking criteria used hence can guide you on any shortfalls in your driving skills prior to taking the actual
driving test. Taking a mock test will greatly enhance your chances of passing your driving test on your first attempt or
if you are resitting the test.</p>

<p>In addition, Pravin (PK) can also act as your support person during your actual test if this is required.</p>

<p><strong>The practical driving test for Overseas Conversions is based on the Full Licence Test.</strong></p>
